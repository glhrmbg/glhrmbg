### Hi there 👋

I'm Guilherme, a ***full-stack software developer*** focused on building ***serverless architectures***, ***AI solutions***, and ***microservices*** for enterprise applications.

I take part in the entire product journey, from *solution architecture design* to implementation and optimization, evaluating technologies, developing components, and estimating resource costs. Currently, I work at [NTT Data Europe & Latam](https://us.nttdata.com/en/) with a focus on *B2B solutions* for large-scale clients.

In addition, I'm completing my Ph.D. in *Biomedical Engineering* at [UFU](https://www.ufu.br), where I work with *Computational Simulations*, *Machine Learning*, and *Neural Networks*.
